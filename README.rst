==================================
20seven Carbon Emacs Configuration
==================================

This is  my emacs configuration.

**Usage**

git clone git://github.com/gregnewman/20seven-emacs.git

ln -s ~/20seven-emacs ~/.emacs.d

ln -s ~/.emacs.d/dot-emacs ~/.emacs

These configs are used daily for my work to include but not limited to Python/Django, Rails, CSS and JS.

**Submodules**

vendor/color-theme/color-theme-github (heads/master)
vendor/color-theme/color-theme-merbivore (heads/master)
vendor/color-theme/twilight-emacs (heads/master)
